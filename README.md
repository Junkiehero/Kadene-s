# Kadene-s

This project includes an algorithm that aims to find the best buy and sell points using stock closing prices. The user fetches historical closing prices for a specific stock via the Alpha Vantage API, and applies Kadane's Algorithm to calculate the maximum profit.

# Contents
- API Integration: The alpha_vantage Python library is used to fetch stock data via the Alpha Vantage API.
- Kadane’s Algorithm: Kadane's Algorithm is applied to find the best buy and sell points for the stock prices.
- Profit Calculation: The user can find the maximum profit and the corresponding buy and sell days for a given stock.


# Features
- Stock Data Fetching: Daily closing prices are fetched via the Alpha Vantage API.
- Maximum Profit Calculation: Kadane’s Algorithm is used to find the highest profit based on the lowest buy price and the highest sell price.
- Day Differences: The difference between the buy and sell days, along with the corresponding prices, is displayed to the user.
- Data Visualization (Optional): Users can process and visualize the price data for further analysis.


# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- alpha_vantage library: Required to fetch data from the API.
- pandas: Required for data processing.

# Usage
- Get Your API Key: To use the Alpha Vantage API, you will need an API key. You can get one for free at Alpha Vantage.

- Enter Your API Key in the Code: Replace the api_key variable with your own Alpha Vantage API key:
  api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

- Fetch Stock Data: Specify the stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple) and pass it as a parameter to the fetch_stock_data function.
  stock_prices = fetch_stock_data("AAPL")

- Calculate Maximum Profit: The max_profit function calculates the best buy and sell days and the maximum profit based on the given stock price data.

# Output
When you run the code, you will get an output like this for the stock symbol you specified:
 Best buy day: 5, price: 135.89
 Best sell day: 10, price: 150.75
 Maximum profit: 14.86

# Algorithm
This project uses Kadane's Algorithm to find the period where the stock prices yield the maximum profit. The algorithm tracks temporary sums of the prices and updates the maximum profit at each step. This allows for high efficiency with an O(n) time complexity.

# Goals
Performance: Quickly analyze stock price data and identify the best buy/sell opportunities.
Efficiency: Achieve accurate results with the least time complexity using Kadane's Algorithm.
